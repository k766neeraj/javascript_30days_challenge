Achievement:
1.Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
2.Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
3.Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
4.Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
5.Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
